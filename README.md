# Work-day-Scheduler-Moment.js

# Description:
Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.
The goal was to create a scheduler for each hour of a 9-5 workday using local storage and time supported by moment.js.
Depends on time present, past and future.
