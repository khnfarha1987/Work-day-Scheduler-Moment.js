# Work-day-Scheduler-Moment.js

# Description:
Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.
The goal was to create a scheduler for each hour of a 9-5 workday using local storage and time supported by moment.js.
Depends on time present, past and future.

# Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.

# Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

# Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

# Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
